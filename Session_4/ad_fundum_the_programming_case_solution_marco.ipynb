    "The ad fundum is a student... let's call it ritual that goes more or less like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One person challenges another at ad fundum, the other usually agrees. They go and pick up a beer or a beverage each. A referee is appointed (in our case, the referee is the program we write and the only adversary in our case is ourself).\n",
    "* The referee asks the two contestants whether they are ready. Once it is the case, she pronounces the following formula: \"À main, à bouche, à cul, nom de dieu!\" (loosely translated, it means \"To the hand, to the mouth, to the bottom, for god's sake\"). Of course, I assume that in catholic universities, they drop the last part so our program should let the player decides if she wants to see this. Also, the word \"cul\" is somewhat vulgar in French and our program should be family friendly (with the difference that, if children want to play, they should drink a non-alcoholic beverage but the program cannot control that, now, can it?). The player should be able to decide if she wants to see the full word or the cleaner \"c\\*\\*\".\n",
    "* Once the referee has pronouced the formula, both contestants have to chug their beer (or their beverage) as fast as possible. For some reason, bystanders usually shout \"et glou\" (which in English would sounds something like \"hay glue\" and which is supposed to mimick the sound of somebody drinking) regularly, so we'll emulate that as well.\n",
    "* Once the first of the player is done with her glass (or whatever container she's drinking from), she's declared the winner and go on to enjoy the rest of the evening (or directly to do another ad fundum).\n"
